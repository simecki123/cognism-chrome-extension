# Cognism-chrome-extension

This is the repository where you can find the Chrome extension I built during my internship at Cognism.

## Description

This Chrome extension detects forms on the webpage you are visiting. It collects all input fields, including hidden ones. For visible fields, users have the option to hide them in future use and enrich each input field using special options presented.

## Video of Functionality

To see the functionality of the extension, you can watch the video below:
